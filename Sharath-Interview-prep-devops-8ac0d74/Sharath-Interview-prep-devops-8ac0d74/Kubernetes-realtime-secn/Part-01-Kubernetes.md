## Scenario #1: Zombie Pods Causing NodeDrain to Hang

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.23, On-prem bare metal, Systemd cgroups
  Scenario

- Summary: Node drain stuck indefinitely due to unresponsive terminating pod.

- What Happened:A pod with a custom finalizer never completed termination, blocking kubectl drain. Even after the pod was marked for deletion, the API server kept waiting because the finalizer wasn’t removed.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Checked kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide to find lingering pods.
  • Found pod stuck in Terminating state for over 20 minutes.
  • Used kubectl describe pod <pod> to identify the presence of a custom finalizer.
  • Investigated controller logs managing the finalizer – the controller had crashed.
  Root Cause: Finalizer logic was never executed because its controller was down, leaving the pod undeletable.

- Fix/Workaround:

kubectl patch pod <pod-name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge

- Lessons Learned:
  Finalizers should have timeout or fail-safe logic.

- How to Avoid:

  • Avoid finalizers unless absolutely necessary.
  • Add monitoring for stuck Terminating pods.
  • Implement retry/timeout logic in finalizer controllers.

## Scenario #2: API Server Crash Due to Excessive CRD Writes

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.24, GKE, heavy use of custom controllers
  Scenario

- Summary: API server crashed due to flooding by a malfunctioning controller creating too many custom resources.

- What Happened:A bug in a controller created thousands of Custom Resources (CRs) in a tight reconciliation loop. Etcd was flooded, leading to slow writes, and the API server eventually became non-responsive.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • API latency increased, leading to 504 Gateway Timeout errors in kubectl.
  • Used kubectl get crds | wc -l to list all CRs.
  • Analyzed controller logs – found infinite reconcile on a specific CR type.
  • etcd disk I/O was maxed.
  Root Cause: Bad logic in reconcile loop: create was always called regardless of the state, creating resource floods.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Scaled the controller to 0 replicas.
  • Manually deleted thousands of stale CRs using batch deletion.

- Lessons Learned:
  Always test reconcile logic in a sandboxed cluster.

- How to Avoid:

  • Implement create/update guards in reconciliation.
  • Add Prometheus alert for high CR count.

## Scenario #3: Node Not Rejoining After Reboot

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.21, Self-managed cluster, Static nodes
  Scenario

- Summary: A rebooted node failed to rejoin the cluster due to kubelet identity mismatch.

- What Happened:After a kernel upgrade and reboot, a node didn’t appear in kubectl get nodes. The kubelet logs showed registration issues.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Checked system logs and kubelet logs.
  • Noticed --hostname-override didn't match the node name registered earlier.
  • kubectl get nodes -o wide showed old hostname; new one mismatched due to DHCP/hostname change.
  Root Cause: Kubelet registered with a hostname that no longer matched its node identity in the cluster.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Re-joined the node using correct --hostname-override.
  • Cleaned up stale node entry from the cluster.

- Lessons Learned:
  Node identity must remain consistent across reboots.

- How to Avoid:

  • Set static hostnames and IPs.
  • Use consistent cloud-init or kubeadm configuration.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #4: Etcd Disk Full Causing API Server Timeout

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.25, Bare-metal cluster
  Scenario

- Summary: etcd ran out of disk space, making API server unresponsive.

- What Happened:The cluster started failing API requests. Etcd logs showed disk space errors, and API server logs showed failed storage operations.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Used df -h on etcd nodes — confirmed disk full.
  • Reviewed /var/lib/etcd – excessive WAL and snapshot files.
  • Used etcdctl to assess DB size.
  Root Cause: Lack of compaction and snapshotting caused disk to fill up with historical revisions and WALs.

- Fix/Workaround:


etcdctl compact <rev>
etcdctl defrag
• Cleaned logs, snapshots, and increased disk space temporarily.

- Lessons Learned:
  etcd requires periodic maintenance.

- How to Avoid:

  • Enable automatic compaction.
  • Monitor disk space usage of etcd volumes.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #5: Misconfigured Taints Blocking Pod Scheduling

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.26, Multi-tenant cluster
  Scenario

- Summary: Critical workloads weren’t getting scheduled due to incorrect node taints.

- What Happened:A user added taints (NoSchedule) to all nodes to isolate their app, but forgot to include tolerations in workloads. Other apps stopped working.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pods stuck in Pending state.
  • Used kubectl describe pod <pod> – reason: no nodes match tolerations.
  • Inspected node taints via kubectl describe node.
  Root Cause: Lack of required tolerations on most workloads.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Removed the inappropriate taints.
  • Re-scheduled workloads.

- Lessons Learned:
  Node taints must be reviewed cluster-wide.

- How to Avoid:

  • Educate teams on node taints and tolerations.
  • Restrict RBAC for node mutation.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #6: Kubelet DiskPressure Loop on Large Image Pulls

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.22, EKS
  Scenario

- Summary: Continuous pod evictions caused by DiskPressure due to image bloating.

- What Happened:A new container image with many layers was deployed. Node’s disk filled up, triggering kubelet’s DiskPressure condition. Evicted pods created a loop.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Checked node conditions: kubectl describe node showed DiskPressure: True.
  • Monitored image cache with crictl images.
  • Node /var/lib/containerd usage exceeded threshold.
  Root Cause: Excessive layering in container image and high pull churn caused disk exhaustion.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Rebuilt image using multistage builds and removed unused layers.
  • Increased ephemeral disk space temporarily.

- Lessons Learned:
  Container image size directly affects node stability.

- How to Avoid:

  • Set resource requests/limits appropriately.
  • Use image scanning to reject bloated images.

## Scenario #7: Node Goes NotReady Due to Clock Skew

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.20, On-prem
  Scenario

- Summary: One node dropped from the cluster due to TLS errors from time skew.

- What Happened:TLS handshakes between the API server and a node started failing. Node became NotReady. Investigation showed NTP daemon was down.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Checked logs for TLS errors: “certificate expired or not yet valid”.
  • Used timedatectl to check drift – node was 45s behind.
  • NTP service was inactive.
  Root Cause: Large clock skew between node and control plane led to invalid TLS sessions.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Restarted NTP sync.
  • Restarted kubelet after sync.

- Lessons Learned:
  Clock sync is critical in TLS-based distributed systems.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use chronyd or systemd-timesyncd.
  • Monitor clock skew across nodes.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #8: API Server High Latency Due to Event Flooding

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.23, Azure AKS
  Scenario

- Summary: An app spamming Kubernetes events slowed down the entire API server.

- What Happened:A custom controller logged frequent events (~50/second), causing the etcd event store to choke.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Prometheus showed spike in event count.
  • kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp showed massive spam.
  • Found misbehaving controller repeating failure events.
  Root Cause: No rate limiting on event creation in controller logic.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Patched controller to rate-limit record.Eventf.
  • Cleaned old events.

- Lessons Learned:
  Events are not free – they impact etcd/API server.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use deduplicated or summarized event logic.
  • Set API server --event-ttl=1h and --eventRateLimit.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #9: CoreDNS CrashLoop on Startup

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.24, DigitalOcean
  Scenario

- Summary: CoreDNS pods kept crashing due to a misconfigured Corefile.

- What Happened:A team added a custom rewrite rule in the Corefile which had invalid syntax. CoreDNS failed to start.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Checked logs: syntax error on startup.
  • Used kubectl describe configmap coredns -n kube-system to inspect.
  • Reproduced issue in test cluster.
  Root Cause: Corefile misconfigured – incorrect directive placement.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Reverted to backup configmap.
  • Restarted CoreDNS.

- Lessons Learned:
  DNS misconfigurations can cascade quickly.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use a CoreDNS validator before applying config.
  • Maintain versioned backups of Corefile.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #10: Control Plane Unavailable After Flannel Misconfiguration

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.18, On-prem, Flannel CNI
  Scenario

- Summary: Misaligned pod CIDRs caused overlay misrouting and API server failure.

- What Happened:A new node was added with a different pod CIDR than what Flannel expected. This broke pod-to-pod and node-to-control-plane communication.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • kubectl timed out from nodes.
  • Logs showed dropped traffic in iptables.
  • Compared --pod-cidr in kubelet and Flannel config.
  Root Cause: Pod CIDRs weren’t consistent across node and Flannel.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Reconfigured node with proper CIDR range.
  • Flushed iptables and restarted Flannel.

- Lessons Learned:
  CNI requires strict configuration consistency.

- How to Avoid:

  • Enforce CIDR policy via admission control.
  • Validate podCIDR ranges before adding new nodes.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #11: kube-proxy IPTables Rules Overlap Breaking Networking

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.22, On-prem with kube-proxy in IPTables mode
  Scenario

- Summary: Services became unreachable due to overlapping custom IPTables rules with kube-proxy rules.

- What Happened:A system admin added custom IPTables NAT rules for external routing, which inadvertently modified the same chains managed by kube-proxy.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • DNS and service access failing intermittently.
  • Ran iptables-save | grep KUBE- – found modified chains.
  • Checked kube-proxy logs: warnings about rule insert failures.
  Root Cause: Manual IPTables rules conflicted with KUBE-SERVICES chains, causing rule precedence issues.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Flushed custom rules and reloaded kube-proxy.

bash
CopyEdit
iptables -F; systemctl restart kube-proxy

- Lessons Learned:
  Never mix manual IPTables rules with kube-proxy-managed chains.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use separate IPTables chains or policy routing.
  • Document any node-level firewall rules clearly.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #12: Stuck CSR Requests Blocking New Node Joins

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.20, kubeadm cluster
  Scenario

- Summary: New nodes couldn’t join due to a backlog of unapproved CSRs.

- What Happened:A spike in expired certificate renewals caused hundreds of CSRs to queue, none of which were being auto-approved. New nodes waited indefinitely.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Ran kubectl get csr – saw >500 pending requests.
  • New nodes stuck at kubelet: “waiting for server signing”.
  • Approval controller was disabled due to misconfiguration.
  Root Cause: Auto-approval for CSRs was turned off during a security patch, but not re-enabled.

- Fix/Workaround:

bash
CopyEdit
kubectl certificate approve <csr-name>
• Re-enabled the CSR approver controller.

- Lessons Learned:
  CSR management is critical for kubelet-node communication.

- How to Avoid:

  • Monitor pending CSRs.
  • Don’t disable kube-controller-manager flags like --cluster-signing-cert-file.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #13: Failed Cluster Upgrade Due to Unready Static Pods

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.21 → v1.23 upgrade, kubeadm
  Scenario

- Summary: Upgrade failed when static control plane pods weren’t ready due to invalid manifests.

- What Happened:During upgrade, etcd didn’t come up because its pod manifest had a typo. Kubelet never started etcd, causing control plane install to hang.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Checked /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml for errors.
  • Used journalctl -u kubelet to see static pod startup errors.
  • Verified pod not running via crictl ps.
  Root Cause: Human error editing the static pod manifest – invalid volumeMount path.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Fixed manifest.
  • Restarted kubelet to load corrected pod.

- Lessons Learned:
  Static pods need strict validation.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use YAML linter on static manifests.
  • Backup manifests before upgrade.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #14: Uncontrolled Logs Filled Disk on All Nodes

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.24, AWS EKS, containerd
  Scenario

- Summary: Application pods generated excessive logs, filling up node /var/log.

- What Happened:A debug flag was accidentally enabled in a backend pod, logging hundreds of lines/sec. The journald and container logs filled up all disk space.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • df -h showed /var/log full.
  • Checked /var/log/containers/ – massive logs for one pod.
  • Used kubectl logs to confirm excessive output.
  Root Cause: A log level misconfiguration caused explosive growth in logs.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Rotated and truncated logs.
  • Restarted container runtime after cleanup.
  • Disabled debug logging.

- Lessons Learned:
  Logging should be controlled and bounded.

- How to Avoid:

  • Set log rotation policies for container runtimes.
  • Enforce sane log levels via CI/CD validation.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #15: Node Drain Fails Due to PodDisruptionBudget Deadlock

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.21, production cluster with HPA and PDB
  Scenario

- Summary: kubectl drain never completed because PDBs blocked eviction.

- What Happened:A deployment had minAvailable: 2 in PDB, but only 2 pods were running. Node drain couldn’t evict either pod without violating PDB.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Ran kubectl describe pdb <name> – saw AllowedDisruptions: 0.
  • Checked deployment and replica count.
  • Tried drain – stuck on pod eviction for 10+ minutes.
  Root Cause: PDB guarantees clashed with under-scaled deployment.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Temporarily edited PDB to reduce minAvailable.
  • Scaled up replicas before drain.

- Lessons Learned:
  PDBs require careful coordination with replica count.

- How to Avoid:

  • Validate PDBs during deployment scale-downs.
  • Create alerts for PDB blocking evictions.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #16: CrashLoop of Kube-Controller-Manager on Boot

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.23, self-hosted control plane
  Scenario

- Summary: Controller-manager crashed on startup due to outdated admission controller configuration.

- What Happened:After an upgrade, the --enable-admission-plugins flag included a deprecated plugin, causing crash.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Checked pod logs in /var/log/pods/.
  • Saw panic error: “unknown admission plugin”.
  • Compared plugin list with K8s documentation.
  Root Cause: Version mismatch between config and actual controller-manager binary.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Removed the deprecated plugin from startup flags.
  • Restarted pod.

- Lessons Learned:
  Admission plugin deprecations are silent but fatal.

- How to Avoid:

  • Track deprecations in each Kubernetes version.
  • Automate validation of startup flags.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #17: Inconsistent Cluster State After Partial Backup Restore

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.24, Velero-based etcd backup
  Scenario

- Summary: A partial etcd restore led to stale object references and broken dependencies.

- What Happened:etcd snapshot was restored, but PVCs and secrets weren’t included. Many pods failed to mount or pull secrets.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pods failed with “volume not found” and “secret missing”.
  • kubectl get pvc --all-namespaces returned empty.
  • Compared resource counts pre- and post-restore.
  Root Cause: Restore did not include volume snapshots or Kubernetes secrets, leading to an incomplete object graph.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Manually recreated PVCs and secrets using backups from another tool.
  • Redeployed apps.

- Lessons Learned:
  etcd backup is not enough alone.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use backup tools that support volume + etcd (e.g., Velero with restic).
  • Periodically test full cluster restores.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #18: kubelet Unable to Pull Images Due to Proxy Misconfig

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.25, Corporate proxy network
  Scenario

- Summary: Nodes failed to pull images from DockerHub due to incorrect proxy environment configuration.

- What Happened:New kubelet config missed NO_PROXY=10.0.0.0/8,kubernetes.default.svc, causing internal DNS failures and image pull errors.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • kubectl describe pod showed ImagePullBackOff.
  • Checked environment variables for kubelet via systemctl show kubelet.
  • Verified lack of NO_PROXY.
  Root Cause: Proxy config caused kubelet to route internal cluster DNS and registry traffic through the proxy.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Updated kubelet service file to include proper NO_PROXY.
  • Restarted kubelet.

- Lessons Learned:
  Proxies in K8s require deep planning.

- How to Avoid:

  • Always set NO_PROXY with service CIDRs and cluster domains.
  • Test image pulls with isolated nodes first.

## Scenario #19: Multiple Nodes Marked Unreachable Due to Flaky Network Interface

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.22, Bare-metal, bonded NICs
  Scenario

- Summary: Flapping interface on switch caused nodes to be marked NotReady intermittently.

- What Happened:A network switch port had flapping issues, leading to periodic loss of node heartbeats.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Node status flapped between Ready and NotReady.
  • Checked NIC logs via dmesg and ethtool.
  • Observed link flaps in switch logs.
  Root Cause: Hardware or cable issue causing loss of connectivity.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Replaced cable and switch port.
  • Set up redundant bonding with failover.

- Lessons Learned:
  Physical layer issues can appear as node flakiness.

- How to Avoid:

  • Monitor NIC link status and configure bonding.
  • Proactively audit switch port health.

## Scenario #20: Node Labels Accidentally Overwritten by DaemonSet

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.24, DaemonSet-based node config
  Scenario

- Summary: A DaemonSet used for node labeling overwrote existing labels used by schedulers.

- What Happened:A platform team deployed a DaemonSet that set node labels like zone=us-east, but it overwrote custom labels like gpu=true.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pods no longer scheduled to GPU nodes.
  • kubectl get nodes --show-labels showed gpu label missing.
  • Checked DaemonSet script – labels were overwritten, not merged.
  Root Cause: Label management script used kubectl label node <node> key=value --overwrite, removing other labels.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Restored original labels from backup.
  • Updated script to merge labels.

- Lessons Learned:
  Node labels are critical for scheduling decisions.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use label merging logic (e.g., fetch current labels, then patch).
  • Protect key node labels via admission controllers.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #21: Cluster Autoscaler Continuously Spawning and Deleting Nodes

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.24, AWS EKS with Cluster Autoscaler
  Scenario

- Summary: The cluster was rapidly scaling up and down, creating instability in workloads.

- What Happened:A misconfigured deployment had a readiness probe that failed intermittently, making pods seem unready. Cluster Autoscaler detected these as unschedulable, triggering new node provisioning. Once the pod appeared healthy again, Autoscaler would scale down.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Monitored Cluster Autoscaler logs (kubectl -n kube-system logs -l app=cluster-autoscaler).
  • Identified repeated scale-up and scale-down messages.
  • Traced back to a specific deployment’s readiness probe.
  Root Cause: Flaky readiness probe created false unschedulable pods.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Fixed the readiness probe to accurately reflect pod health.
  • Tuned scale-down-delay-after-add and scale-down-unneeded-time settings.

- Lessons Learned:
  Readiness probes directly impact Autoscaler decisions.

- How to Avoid:

  • Validate all probes before production deployments.
  • Use Autoscaler logging to audit scaling activity.

## Scenario #22: Stale Finalizers Preventing Namespace Deletion

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.21, self-managed
  Scenario

- Summary: A namespace remained in “Terminating” state indefinitely.

- What Happened:The namespace contained resources with finalizers pointing to a deleted controller. Kubernetes waited forever for the finalizer to complete cleanup.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Ran kubectl get ns <name> -o json – saw dangling finalizers.
  • Checked for the corresponding CRD/controller – it was uninstalled.
  Root Cause: Finalizers without owning controller cause resource lifecycle deadlocks.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Manually removed finalizers using a patched JSON:

bash
CopyEdit
kubectl patch ns <name> -p '{"spec":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge

- Lessons Learned:
  Always delete CRs before removing the CRD or controller.

- How to Avoid:

  • Implement controller cleanup logic.
  • Audit finalizers periodically.

## Scenario #23: CoreDNS CrashLoop Due to Invalid ConfigMap Update

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.23, managed GKE
  Scenario

- Summary: CoreDNS stopped resolving names cluster-wide after a config update.

- What Happened:A platform engineer edited the CoreDNS ConfigMap to add a rewrite rule, but introduced a syntax error. The new pods started crashing, and DNS resolution stopped working across the cluster.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Ran kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns – saw config parse errors.
  • Used kubectl describe pod to confirm CrashLoopBackOff.
  • Validated config against CoreDNS docs.
  Root Cause: Invalid configuration line in CoreDNS ConfigMap.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Rolled back to previous working ConfigMap.
  • Restarted CoreDNS pods to pick up change.

- Lessons Learned:
  ConfigMap changes can instantly affect cluster-wide services.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use coredns -conf <file> locally to validate changes.
  • Test changes in a non-prod namespace before rollout.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #24: Pod Eviction Storm Due to DiskPressure

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.25, self-managed, containerd
  Scenario

- Summary: A sudden spike in image pulls caused all nodes to hit disk pressure, leading to massive pod evictions.

- What Happened:A nightly batch job triggered a container image update across thousands of pods. Pulling these images used all available space in /var/lib/containerd, which led to node condition DiskPressure, forcing eviction of critical workloads.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Used kubectl describe node – found DiskPressure=True.
  • Inspected /var/lib/containerd/io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.overlayfs/.
  • Checked image pull logs.
  Root Cause: No image GC and too many simultaneous pulls filled up disk space.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Pruned unused images.
  • Enabled container runtime garbage collection.

- Lessons Learned:
  DiskPressure can take down entire nodes without warning.

- How to Avoid:

  • Set eviction thresholds properly in kubelet.
  • Enforce rolling update limits (maxUnavailable).

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #25: Orphaned PVs Causing Unscheduled Pods

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.20, CSI storage on vSphere
  Scenario

- Summary: PVCs were stuck in Pending state due to existing orphaned PVs in Released state.

- What Happened:After pod deletion, PVs went into Released state but were never cleaned up due to missing ReclaimPolicy logic. When new PVCs requested the same storage class, provisioning failed.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Ran kubectl get pvc – saw Pending PVCs.
  • kubectl get pv – old PVs stuck in Released.
  • CSI driver logs showed volume claim conflicts.
  Root Cause: ReclaimPolicy set to Retain and no manual cleanup.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Manually deleted orphaned PVs.
  • Changed ReclaimPolicy to Delete for similar volumes.

- Lessons Learned:
  PV lifecycle must be actively monitored.

- How to Avoid:

  • Add cleanup logic in storage lifecycle.
  • Implement PV alerts based on state.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #26: Taints and Tolerations Mismatch Prevented Workload Scheduling

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.22, managed AKS
  Scenario

- Summary: Workloads failed to schedule on new nodes that had a taint the workloads didn’t tolerate.

- What Happened:Platform team added a new node pool with node-role.kubernetes.io/gpu:NoSchedule, but forgot to add tolerations to GPU workloads.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • kubectl describe pod – showed reason: “0/3 nodes are available: node(s) had taints”.
  • Checked node taints via kubectl get nodes -o json.
  Root Cause: Taints on new node pool weren’t matched by tolerations in pods.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Added proper tolerations to workloads:

yaml
CopyEdit
tolerations:

- key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/gpu"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoSchedule"

- Lessons Learned:
  Node taints should be coordinated with scheduling policies.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use preset toleration templates in CI/CD pipelines.
  • Test new node pools with dummy workloads.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #27: Node Bootstrap Failure Due to Unavailable Container Registry

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.21, on-prem, private registry
  Scenario

- Summary: New nodes failed to join the cluster due to container runtime timeout when pulling base images.

- What Happened:The internal Docker registry was down during node provisioning, so containerd couldn't pull pauseand CNI images. Nodes stayed in NotReady state.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • journalctl -u containerd – repeated image pull failures.
  • Node conditions showed ContainerRuntimeNotReady.
  Root Cause: Bootstrap process relies on image pulls from unavailable registry.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Brought internal registry back online.
  • Pre-pulled pause/CNI images to node image templates.

- Lessons Learned:
  Registry availability is a bootstrap dependency.

- How to Avoid:

  • Preload all essential images into AMI/base image.
  • Monitor registry uptime independently.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #28: kubelet Fails to Start Due to Expired TLS Certs

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.19, kubeadm cluster
  Scenario

- Summary: Several nodes went NotReady after reboot due to kubelet failing to start with expired client certs.

- What Happened:Kubelet uses a client certificate for authentication with the API server. These are typically auto-rotated, but the nodes were offline when the rotation was due.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • journalctl -u kubelet – cert expired error.
  • /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem – expired date.
  Root Cause: Kubelet cert rotation missed due to node downtime.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Regenerated kubelet certs using kubeadm.

bash
CopyEdit
kubeadm certs renew all

- Lessons Learned:
  Cert rotation has a dependency on uptime.

- How to Avoid:

  • Monitor cert expiry proactively.
  • Rotate certs manually before planned outages.

## Scenario #29: kube-scheduler Crash Due to Invalid Leader Election Config

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.24, custom scheduler deployment
  Scenario

- Summary: kube-scheduler pod failed with panic due to misconfigured leader election flags.

- What Happened:An override in the Helm chart introduced an invalid leader election namespace, causing the scheduler to panic and crash on startup.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pod logs showed panic: cannot create leader election record.
  • Checked Helm values – found wrong namespace name.
  Root Cause: Namespace specified for leader election did not exist.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Created the missing namespace.
  • Restarted the scheduler pod.

- Lessons Learned:
  Leader election is sensitive to namespace scoping.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use default kube-system unless explicitly scoped.
  • Validate all scheduler configs with CI linting.

## Scenario #30: Cluster DNS Resolution Broken After Calico CNI Update

- Category: Cluster Management

- Environment: K8s v1.23, self-hosted Calico
  Scenario

- Summary: DNS resolution broke after Calico CNI update due to iptables policy drop changes.

- What Happened:New version of Calico enforced stricter iptables drop policies, blocking traffic from CoreDNS to pods.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • DNS requests timed out.
  • Packet capture showed ICMP unreachable from pods to CoreDNS.
  • Checked Calico policy and iptables rules.
  Root Cause: Calico’s default deny policy applied to kube-dns traffic.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Added explicit Calico policy allowing kube-dns to pod traffic.

yaml:
egress:

- action: Allow
  destination:
  selector: "k8s-app == 'kube-dns'"

- Lessons Learned:
  CNI policy changes can impact DNS without warning.

- How to Avoid:

  • Review and test all network policy upgrades in staging.
  • Use canary upgrade strategy for CNI.

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.22, EBS CSI Driver on EKS

- Summary: A node crash caused a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to be stuck in Terminating, blocking pod deletion.

- What Happened:The node hosting the pod with the PVC crashed and never returned. The volume was still attached, and Kubernetes couldn’t cleanly unmount or delete it.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Described the PVC: status was Terminating.
  • Checked finalizers on the PVC object.
  • Verified the volume was still attached to the crashed node via AWS Console.
  Root Cause: The volume attachment record wasn’t cleaned up due to the ungraceful node failure.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Manually removed the PVC finalizers.
  • Used aws ec2 detach-volume to forcibly detach.

- Lessons Learned:
  Finalizers can block PVC deletion in edge cases.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use the external-attacher CSI sidecar with leader election.
  • Implement automation to detect and clean up stuck attachments.

## Scenario #302: Data Corruption on HostPath Volumes

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.20, Bare Metal

- Summary: Multiple pods sharing a HostPath volume led to inconsistent file states and eventual corruption.

- What Happened:Two pods were writing to the same HostPath volume concurrently, which wasn’t designed for concurrent write access. Files became corrupted due to race conditions.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Identified common HostPath mount across pods.
  • Checked application logs — showed file write conflicts.
  • Inspected corrupted data on disk.
  Root Cause: Lack of coordination and access control on shared HostPath.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Moved workloads to CSI-backed volumes with ReadWriteOnce enforcement.
  • Ensured only one pod accessed a volume at a time.

- Lessons Learned:
  HostPath volumes offer no isolation or locking guarantees.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use CSI volumes with enforced access modes.
  • Avoid HostPath unless absolutely necessary.

## Scenario #303: Volume Mount Fails Due to Node Affinity Mismatch

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23, GCE PD on GKE

- Summary: A pod was scheduled on a node that couldn’t access the persistent disk due to zone mismatch.

- What Happened:A StatefulSet PVC was bound to a disk in us-central1-a, but the pod got scheduled in us-central1-b, causing volume mount failure.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Described pod: showed MountVolume.MountDevice failed.
  • Described PVC and PV: zone mismatch confirmed.
  • Looked at scheduler decisions — no awareness of volume zone.
  Root Cause: Scheduler was unaware of zone constraints on the PV.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Added topology.kubernetes.io/zone node affinity to match PV.
  • Ensured StatefulSets used storage classes with volume binding mode WaitForFirstConsumer.

- Lessons Learned:
  Without delayed binding, PVs can bind in zones that don’t match future pods.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use WaitForFirstConsumer for dynamic provisioning.
  • Always define zone-aware topology constraints.

## Scenario #304: PVC Not Rescheduled After Node Deletion

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.21, Azure Disk CSI

- Summary: A StatefulSet pod failed to reschedule after its node was deleted, due to Azure disk still being attached.

- What Happened:A pod using Azure Disk was on a node that was manually deleted. Azure did not automatically detach the disk, so rescheduling failed.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pod stuck in ContainerCreating.
  • CSI logs showed "Volume is still attached to another node".
  • Azure Portal confirmed volume was attached.
  Root Cause: Manual node deletion bypassed volume detachment logic.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Detached the disk from the Azure console.
  • Recreated pod successfully on another node.

- Lessons Learned:
  Manual infrastructure changes can break Kubernetes assumptions.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use automation/scripts for safe node draining and deletion.
  • Monitor CSI detachment status on node removal.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #305: Long PVC Rebinding Time on StatefulSet Restart

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, Rook Ceph

- Summary: Restarting a StatefulSet with many PVCs caused long downtime due to slow rebinding.

- What Happened:A 20-replica StatefulSet was restarted, and each pod waited for its PVC to rebind and attach. Ceph mount operations were sequential and slow.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pods stuck at Init stage for 15–20 minutes.
  • Ceph logs showed delayed attachment per volume.
  • Described PVCs: bound but not mounted.
  Root Cause: Sequential volume mount throttling and inefficient CSI attach policies.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Tuned CSI attach concurrency.
  • Split the StatefulSet into smaller chunks.

- Lessons Learned:
  Large-scale StatefulSets need volume attach tuning.

- How to Avoid:

  • Parallelize pod restarts using partitioned rollouts.
  • Monitor CSI mount throughput.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #306: CSI Volume Plugin Crash Loops Due to Secret Rotation

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.25, Vault CSI Provider

- Summary: Volume plugin entered crash loop after secret provider’s token was rotated unexpectedly.

- What Happened:A service account used by the Vault CSI plugin had its token rotated mid-operation. The plugin couldn’t fetch new credentials and crashed.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • CrashLoopBackOff on csi-vault-provider pods.
  • Logs showed "401 Unauthorized" from Vault.
  • Verified service account token changed recently.
  Root Cause: No logic in plugin to handle token change or re-auth.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Restarted the CSI plugin pods.
  • Upgraded plugin to a version with token refresh logic.

- Lessons Learned:
  CSI providers must gracefully handle credential rotations.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use projected service account tokens with auto-refresh.
  • Monitor plugin health on secret rotations.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #307: ReadWriteMany PVCs Cause IO Bottlenecks

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23, NFS-backed PVCs

- Summary: Heavy read/write on a shared PVC caused file IO contention and throttling across pods.

- What Happened:Multiple pods used a shared ReadWriteMany PVC for scratch space. Concurrent writes led to massive IO wait times and high pod latency.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • High pod latency and CPU idle time.
  • Checked NFS server: high disk and network usage.
  • Application logs showed timeouts.
  Root Cause: No coordination or locking on shared writable volume.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Partitioned workloads to use isolated volumes.
  • Added cache layer for reads.

- Lessons Learned:
  RWX volumes are not always suitable for concurrent writes.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use RWX volumes for read-shared data only.
  • Avoid writes unless using clustered filesystems (e.g., CephFS).

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #308: PVC Mount Timeout Due to PodSecurityPolicy

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.21, PSP Enabled Cluster

- Summary: A pod couldn’t mount a volume because PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) rejected required fsGroup.

- What Happened:A storage class required fsGroup for volume mount permissions. The pod didn’t set it, and PSP disallowed dynamic group assignment.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pod stuck in CreateContainerConfigError.
  • Events showed “pod rejected by PSP”.
  • Storage class required fsGroup.
  Root Cause: Incompatible PSP with volume mount security requirements.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Modified PSP to allow required fsGroup range.
  • Updated pod security context.

- Lessons Learned:
  Storage plugins often need security context alignment.

- How to Avoid:

  • Review storage class requirements.
  • Align security policies with volume specs.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #309: Orphaned PVs After Namespace Deletion

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.20, Self-Hosted

- Summary: Deleting a namespace did not clean up PersistentVolumes, leading to leaked storage.

- What Happened:A team deleted a namespace with PVCs, but the associated PVs (with Retain policy) remained and weren’t cleaned up.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Listed all PVs: found orphaned volumes in Released state.
  • Checked reclaim policy: Retain.
  Root Cause: Manual cleanup required for Retain policy.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Deleted old PVs and disks manually.
  • Changed reclaim policy to Delete for dynamic volumes.

- Lessons Learned:
  Reclaim policy should match cleanup expectations.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use Delete unless you need manual volume recovery.
  • Monitor Released PVs for leaks.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #310: StorageClass Misconfiguration Blocks Dynamic Provisioning

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.25, GKE

- Summary: New PVCs failed to bind due to a broken default StorageClass with incorrect parameters.

- What Happened:A recent update modified the default StorageClass to use a non-existent disk type. All PVCs created with default settings failed provisioning.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • PVCs in Pending state.
  • Checked events: “failed to provision volume with StorageClass”.
  • Described StorageClass: invalid parameter type: ssd2.
  Root Cause: Mistyped disk type in StorageClass definition.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Corrected StorageClass parameters.
  • Manually bound PVCs with valid classes.

- Lessons Learned:
  Default StorageClass affects many workloads.

- How to Avoid:

  • Validate StorageClass on cluster upgrades.
  • Use automated tests for provisioning paths.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #311: StatefulSet Volume Cloning Results in Data Leakage

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, CSI Volume Cloning enabled

- Summary: Cloning PVCs between StatefulSet pods led to shared data unexpectedly appearing in new replicas.

- What Happened:Engineers used volume cloning to duplicate data for new pods. They assumed data would be copied and isolated. However, clones preserved file locks and session metadata, which caused apps to behave erratically.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • New pods accessed old session data unexpectedly.
  • lsblk and md5sum on cloned volumes showed identical data.
  • Verified cloning was done via StorageClass that didn't support true snapshot isolation.
  Root Cause: Misunderstanding of cloning behavior — logical clone ≠ deep copy.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Stopped cloning and switched to backup/restore-based provisioning.
  • Used rsync with integrity checks instead.

- Lessons Learned:
  Not all clones are deep copies; understand your CSI plugin's clone semantics.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use cloning only for stateless data unless supported thoroughly.
  • Validate cloned volume content before production use.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #312: Volume Resize Not Reflected in Mounted Filesystem

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.22, OpenEBS

- Summary: Volume expansion was successful on the PV, but pods didn’t see the increased space.

- What Happened:After increasing PVC size, the PV reflected the new size, but df -h inside the pod still showed the old size.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Checked PVC and PV: showed expanded size.
  • Pod logs indicated no disk space.
  • mount inside pod showed volume was mounted but not resized.
  Root Cause: Filesystem resize not triggered automatically.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Restarted pod to remount the volume and trigger resize.
  • Verified resize2fs logs in CSI driver.

- Lessons Learned:
  Volume resizing may require pod restarts depending on CSI driver.

- How to Avoid:

  • Schedule a rolling restart after volume resize operations.
  • Check if your CSI driver supports online filesystem resizing.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #313: CSI Controller Pod Crash Due to Log Overflow

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23, Longhorn

- Summary: The CSI controller crashed repeatedly due to unbounded logging filling up ephemeral storage.

- What Happened:A looped RPC error generated thousands of log lines per second. Node /var/log/containers hit 100% disk usage.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • kubectl describe pod: showed OOMKilled and failed to write logs.
  • Checked node disk: /var was full.
  • Logs rotated too slowly.
  Root Cause: Verbose logging + missing log throttling + small disk.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Added log rate limits via CSI plugin config.
  • Increased node ephemeral storage.

- Lessons Learned:
  Logging misconfigurations can become outages.

- How to Avoid:

  • Monitor log volume and disk usage.
  • Use log rotation and retention policies.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #314: PVs Stuck in Released Due to Missing Finalizer Removal

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.21, NFS

- Summary: PVCs were deleted, but PVs remained stuck in Released, preventing reuse.

- What Happened:PVC deletion left behind PVs marked as Released, and the NFS driver didn’t remove finalizers, blocking clean-up.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Listed PVs: showed Released, with kubernetes.io/pv-protection finalizer still present.
  • Couldn’t bind new PVCs due to status: Released.
  Root Cause: Driver didn’t implement Delete reclaim logic properly.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Patched PVs to remove finalizers.
  • Recycled or deleted volumes manually.

- Lessons Learned:
  Some drivers require manual cleanup unless fully CSI-compliant.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use CSI drivers with full lifecycle support.
  • Monitor PV statuses regularly.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #315: CSI Driver DaemonSet Deployment Missing Tolerations for Taints

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.25, Bare Metal

- Summary: CSI Node plugin DaemonSet didn’t deploy on all nodes due to missing taint tolerations.

- What Happened:Storage nodes were tainted (node-role.kubernetes.io/storage:NoSchedule), and the CSI DaemonSet didn’t tolerate it, so pods failed to mount volumes.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • CSI node pods not scheduled on certain nodes.
  • Checked node taints vs DaemonSet tolerations.
  • Pods stuck in Pending.
  Root Cause: Taint/toleration mismatch in CSI node plugin manifest.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Added required tolerations to DaemonSet.

- Lessons Learned:
  Storage plugins must tolerate relevant node taints to function correctly.

- How to Avoid:

  • Review node taints and CSI tolerations during setup.
  • Use node affinity and tolerations for critical system components.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #316: Mount Propagation Issues with Sidecar Containers

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.22, GKE

- Summary: Sidecar containers didn’t see mounted volumes due to incorrect mountPropagation settings.

- What Happened:An app container wrote to a mounted path, but sidecar container couldn’t read the changes.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Logs in sidecar showed empty directory.
  • Checked volumeMounts: missing mountPropagation: Bidirectional.
  Root Cause: Default mount propagation is None, blocking volume visibility between containers.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Added mountPropagation: Bidirectional to shared volumeMounts.

- Lessons Learned:
  Without correct propagation, shared volumes don’t work across containers.

- How to Avoid:

  • Understand container mount namespaces.
  • Always define propagation when using shared mounts.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #317: File Permissions Reset on Pod Restart

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.20, CephFS

- Summary: Pod volume permissions reset after each restart, breaking application logic.

- What Happened:App wrote files with specific UID/GID. After restart, files were inaccessible due to CephFS resetting ownership.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Compared ls -l before/after restart.
  • Storage class used fsGroup: 9999 by default.
  Root Cause: PodSecurityContext didn't override fsGroup, so default applied every time.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Set explicit securityContext.fsGroup in pod spec.

- Lessons Learned:
  CSI plugins may enforce ownership unless overridden.

- How to Avoid:

  • Always declare expected ownership with securityContext.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #318: Volume Mount Succeeds but Application Can't Write

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23, EBS

- Summary: Volume mounted correctly, but application failed to write due to filesystem mismatch.

- What Happened:App expected xfs but volume formatted as ext4. Some operations silently failed or corrupted.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Application logs showed invalid argument on file ops.
  • CSI driver defaulted to ext4.
  • Verified with df -T.
  Root Cause: Application compatibility issue with default filesystem.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Used storage class parameter to specify xfs.

- Lessons Learned:
  Filesystem types matter for certain workloads.

- How to Avoid:

  • Align volume formatting with application expectations.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #319: Volume Snapshot Restore Includes Corrupt Data

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, Velero + CSI Snapshots

- Summary: Snapshot-based restore brought back corrupted state due to hot snapshot timing.

- What Happened:Velero snapshot was taken during active write burst. Filesystem was inconsistent at time of snapshot.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • App logs showed corrupted files after restore.
  • Snapshot logs showed no quiescing.
  • Restore replayed same state.
  Root Cause: No pre-freeze or app-level quiescing before snapshot.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Paused writes before snapshot.
  • Enabled filesystem freeze hook in Velero plugin.

- Lessons Learned:
  Snapshots must be coordinated with app state.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use pre/post hooks for consistent snapshotting.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #320: Zombie Volumes Occupying Cloud Quota

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.25, AWS EBS

- Summary: Deleted PVCs didn’t release volumes due to failed detach steps, leading to quota exhaustion.

- What Happened:PVCs were deleted, but EBS volumes stayed in-use, blocking provisioning of new ones due to quota limits.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Checked AWS Console: volumes remained.
  • Described events: detach errors during node crash.
  Root Cause: CSI driver missed final detach due to abrupt node termination.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Manually detached and deleted volumes.
  • Adjusted controller retry limits.

- Lessons Learned:
  Cloud volumes may silently linger even after PVC/PV deletion.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use cloud resource monitoring.
  • Add alerts for orphaned volumes.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #321: Volume Snapshot Garbage Collection Fails

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.25, CSI Snapshotter with Velero

- Summary: Volume snapshots piled up because snapshot objects were not getting garbage collected after use.

- What Happened:Snapshots triggered via Velero remained in the cluster even after restore, eventually exhausting cloud snapshot limits and storage quota.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Listed all VolumeSnapshots and VolumeSnapshotContents — saw hundreds still in ReadyToUse: true state.
  • Checked finalizers on snapshot objects — found snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/volumesnapshot not removed.
  • Velero logs showed successful restore but no cleanup action.
  Root Cause: Snapshot GC controller didn’t remove finalizers due to missing permissions in Velero's service account.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Added required RBAC rules to Velero.
  • Manually deleted stale snapshot objects.

- Lessons Learned:
  Improperly configured snapshot permissions can stall GC.

- How to Avoid:

  • Always test snapshot and restore flows end-to-end.
  • Enable automated cleanup in your backup tooling.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #322: Volume Mount Delays Due to Node Drain Stale Attachment

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23, AWS EBS CSI

- Summary: Volumes took too long to attach on new nodes after pod rescheduling due to stale attachment metadata.

- What Happened:After draining a node for maintenance, workloads failed over, but volume attachments still pointed to old node, causing delays in remount.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Described PV: still had attachedNode as drained one.
  • Cloud logs showed volume in-use errors.
  • CSI controller didn’t retry detach fast enough.
  Root Cause: Controller had exponential backoff on detach retries.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Reduced backoff limit in CSI controller config.
  • Used manual detach via cloud CLI in emergencies.

- Lessons Learned:
  Volume operations can get stuck in edge-node cases.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use health checks to ensure detach success before draining.
  • Monitor VolumeAttachment objects during node ops.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #323: Application Writes Lost After Node Reboot

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.21, Local Persistent Volumes

- Summary: After a node reboot, pod restarted, but wrote to a different volume path, resulting in apparent data loss.

- What Happened:Application data wasn’t persisted after a power cycle because the mount point dynamically changed.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Compared volume paths before and after reboot.
  • Found PV had hostPath mount with no stable binding.
  • Volume wasn’t pinned to specific disk partition.
  Root Cause: Local PV was defined with generic hostPath, not using local volume plugin with device references.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Refactored PV to use local with nodeAffinity.
  • Explicitly mounted disk partitions.

- Lessons Learned:
  hostPath should not be used for production data.

- How to Avoid:

  • Always use local storage plugin for node-local disks.
  • Avoid loosely defined persistent paths.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #324: Pod CrashLoop Due to Read-Only Volume Remount

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.22, GCP Filestore

- Summary: Pod volume was remounted as read-only after a transient network disconnect, breaking app write logic.

- What Happened:During a brief NFS outage, volume was remounted in read-only mode by the NFS client. Application kept crashing due to inability to write logs.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Checked mount logs: showed NFS remounted as read-only.
  • kubectl describe pod: showed volume still mounted.
  • Pod logs: permission denied on write.
  Root Cause: NFS client behavior defaults to remount as read-only after timeout.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Restarted pod to trigger clean remount.
  • Tuned NFS mount options (soft, timeo, retry).

- Lessons Learned:
  NFS remount behavior can silently switch access mode.

- How to Avoid:

  • Monitor for dmesg or NFS client remounts.
  • Add alerts for unexpected read-only volume transitions.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #325: Data Corruption on Shared Volume With Two Pods

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23, NFS PVC shared by 2 pods

- Summary: Two pods writing to the same volume caused inconsistent files and data loss.

- What Happened:Both pods ran jobs writing to the same output files. Without file locking, one pod overwrote data from the other.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Logs showed incomplete file writes.
  • File hashes changed mid-run.
  • No mutual exclusion mechanism implemented.
  Root Cause: Shared volume used without locking or coordination between pods.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Refactored app logic to coordinate file writes via leader election.
  • Used a queue-based processing system.

- Lessons Learned:
  Shared volume access must be controlled explicitly.

- How to Avoid:

  • Never assume coordination when using shared volumes.
  • Use per-pod PVCs or job-level locking.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #326: Mount Volume Exceeded Timeout

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.26, Azure Disk CSI

- Summary: Pod remained stuck in ContainerCreating state because volume mount operations timed out.

- What Happened:CSI node plugin had stale cache and attempted mount on incorrect device path. Retry logic delayed pod start by ~15 minutes.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Described pod: stuck with Unable to mount volume error.
  • Node CSI logs: device not found.
  • Saw old mount references in plugin cache.
  Root Cause: Plugin did not invalidate mount state properly after a failed mount.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Cleared plugin cache manually.
  • Upgraded CSI driver to fixed version.

- Lessons Learned:
  CSI drivers can introduce delays through stale state.

- How to Avoid:

  • Keep CSI drivers up-to-date.
  • Use pre-mount checks to validate device paths.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #327: Static PV Bound to Wrong PVC

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.21, Manually created PVs

- Summary: A misconfigured static PV got bound to the wrong PVC, exposing sensitive data.

- What Happened:Two PVCs had overlapping selectors. The PV intended for app-A was bound to app-B, which accessed restricted files.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Checked PV annotations: saw wrong PVC UID.
  • File system showed app-A data.
  • Both PVCs used identical storageClassName and no selector.
  Root Cause: Ambiguous PV selection caused unintended binding.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Used volumeName field in PVCs for direct binding.
  • Set explicit labels/selectors to isolate.

- Lessons Learned:
  Manual PVs require strict binding rules.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use volumeName for static PV binding.
  • Avoid reusing storageClassName across different apps.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #328: Pod Eviction Due to DiskPressure Despite PVC

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.22, Local PVs

- Summary: Node evicted pods due to DiskPressure, even though app used dedicated PVC backed by a separate disk.

- What Happened:Node root disk filled up with log data, triggering eviction manager. The PVC itself was healthy and not full.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Node describe: showed DiskPressure condition true.
  • Application pod evicted due to node pressure, not volume pressure.
  • Root disk had full /var/log.
  Root Cause: Kubelet doesn’t distinguish between root disk and attached volumes for eviction triggers.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Cleaned logs from root disk.
  • Moved logging to PVC-backed location.

- Lessons Learned:
  PVCs don’t protect from node-level disk pressure.

- How to Avoid:

  • Monitor node root disks in addition to volume usage.
  • Redirect logs and temp files to PVCs.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #329: Pod Gets Stuck Due to Ghost Mount Point

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.20, iSCSI volumes

- Summary: Pod failed to start because the mount point was partially deleted, leaving the system confused.

- What Happened:After node crash, the iSCSI mount folder remained but device wasn’t attached. New pod couldn’t proceed due to leftover mount artifacts.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • CSI logs: mount path exists but not a mount point.
  • mount | grep iscsi — returned nothing.
  • ls /mnt/... — folder existed with empty contents.
  Root Cause: Stale mount folder confused CSI plugin logic.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Manually deleted stale mount folders.
  • Restarted kubelet on affected node.

- Lessons Learned:
  Mount lifecycle must be cleanly managed.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use pre-start hooks to validate mount point integrity.
  • Include cleanup logic in custom CSI deployments.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #330: PVC Resize Broke StatefulSet Ordering

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, StatefulSets + RWO PVCs

- Summary: When resizing PVCs, StatefulSet pods restarted in parallel, violating ordinal guarantees.

- What Happened:PVC expansion triggered pod restarts, but multiple pods came up simultaneously, causing database quorum failures.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Checked StatefulSet controller behavior — PVC resize didn’t preserve pod startup order.
  • App logs: quorum could not be established.
  Root Cause: StatefulSet controller didn’t serialize PVC resizes.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Manually controlled pod restarts during PVC resize.
  • Added readiness gates to enforce sequential boot.

- Lessons Learned:
  StatefulSets don't coordinate PVC changes well.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use podManagementPolicy: OrderedReady.
  • Handle resizes during maintenance windows.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #331: ReadAfterWrite Inconsistency on Object Store-Backed CSI

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.26, MinIO CSI driver, Ceph RGW backend

- Summary: Applications experienced stale reads immediately after writing to the same file via CSI mount backed by an S3-like object store.

- What Happened:A distributed app wrote metadata and then read it back to validate—however, the file content was outdated due to eventual consistency in object backend.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Logged file hashes before and after write — mismatch seen.
  • Found underlying storage was S3-compatible with eventual consistency.
  • CSI driver buffered writes asynchronously.
  Root Cause: Object store semantics (eventual consistency) not suitable for synchronous read-after-write patterns.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Introduced write barriers and retry logic in app.
  • Switched to CephFS for strong consistency.

- Lessons Learned:
  Object store-backed volumes need strong consistency guards.

- How to Avoid:

  • Avoid using S3-style backends for workloads expecting POSIX semantics.
  • Use CephFS, NFS, or block storage for transactional I/O.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #332: PV Resize Fails After Node Reboot

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, AWS EBS

- Summary: After a node reboot, a PVC resize request remained pending, blocking pod start.

- What Happened:VolumeExpansion was triggered via PVC patch. But after a node reboot, controller couldn't find the in-use mount point to complete fsResize.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • PVC status.conditions showed FileSystemResizePending.
  • CSI node plugin logs showed missing device.
  • Node reboot removed mount references prematurely.
  Root Cause: Resize operation depends on volume being mounted at the time of filesystem expansion.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Reattached volume by starting pod temporarily on the node.
  • Resize completed automatically.

- Lessons Learned:
  Filesystem resize requires node readiness and volume mount.

- How to Avoid:

  • Schedule resizes during stable node windows.
  • Use pvc-resize readiness gates in automation.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #333: CSI Driver Crash Loops on VolumeAttach

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.22, OpenEBS Jiva CSI

- Summary: CSI node plugin entered CrashLoopBackOff due to panic during volume attach, halting all storage provisioning.

- What Happened:VolumeAttachment object triggered a plugin bug—CSI crashed during RPC call, making storage class unusable.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Checked CSI node logs — Go panic in attach handler.
  • Pods using Jiva SC failed with AttachVolume.Attach failed error.
  • CSI pod restarted every few seconds.
  Root Cause: Volume metadata had an unexpected field due to version mismatch.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Rolled back CSI driver to stable version.
  • Purged corrupted volume metadata.

- Lessons Learned:
  CSI versioning must be tightly managed.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use upgrade staging before deploying new CSI versions.
  • Enable CSI health monitoring via liveness probes.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #334: PVC Binding Fails Due to Multiple Default StorageClasses

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23

- Summary: PVC creation failed intermittently because the cluster had two storage classes marked as default.

- What Happened:Two different teams installed their storage plugins (EBS and Rook), both marked default. PVC binding randomly chose one.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Ran kubectl get storageclass — two entries with is-default-class=true.
  • PVCs had no storageClassName, leading to random binding.
  • One SC used unsupported reclaimPolicy.
  Root Cause: Multiple default StorageClasses confuse the scheduler.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Patched one SC to remove the default annotation.
  • Explicitly specified SC in Helm charts.

- Lessons Learned:
  Default SC conflicts silently break provisioning.

- How to Avoid:

  • Enforce single default SC via cluster policy.
  • Always specify storageClassName explicitly in critical apps.

## Scenario #335: Zombie VolumeAttachment Blocks New PVC

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.21, Longhorn

- Summary: After a node crash, a VolumeAttachment object was not garbage collected, blocking new PVCs from attaching.

- What Happened:Application tried to use the volume, but Longhorn saw the old attachment from a dead node and refused reattachment.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Listed VolumeAttachment resources — found one pointing to a non-existent node.
  • Longhorn logs: volume already attached to another node.
  • Node was removed forcefully.
  Root Cause: VolumeAttachment controller did not clean up orphaned entries on node deletion.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Manually deleted VolumeAttachment.
  • Restarted CSI pods to refresh state.

- Lessons Learned:
  Controller garbage collection is fragile post-node failure.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use node lifecycle hooks to detach volumes gracefully.
  • Alert on dangling VolumeAttachments.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #336: Persistent Volume Bound But Not Mounted

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.25, NFS

- Summary: Pod entered Running state, but data was missing because PV was bound but not properly mounted.

- What Happened:NFS server was unreachable during pod start. Pod started, but mount failed silently due to default retry behavior.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • mount output lacked NFS entry.
  • Pod logs: No such file or directory errors.
  • CSI logs showed silent NFS timeout.
  Root Cause: CSI driver didn’t fail pod start when mount failed.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Added mountOptions: [hard,intr] to NFS SC.
  • Set pod readiness probe to check file existence.

- Lessons Learned:
  Mount failures don’t always stop pod startup.

- How to Avoid:

  • Validate mounts via init containers or probes.
  • Monitor CSI logs on pod lifecycle events.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #337: CSI Snapshot Restore Overwrites Active Data

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.26, CSI snapshots (v1beta1)

- Summary: User triggered a snapshot restore to an existing PVC, unintentionally overwriting live data.

- What Happened:Snapshot restore process recreated PVC from source but didn't prevent overwriting an already-mounted volume.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Traced VolumeSnapshotContent and PVC references.
  • PVC had reclaimPolicy: Retain, but was reused.
  • SnapshotClass used Delete policy.
  Root Cause: No validation existed between snapshot restore and in-use PVCs.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Restored snapshot to a new PVC and used manual copy/move.
  • Added lifecycle checks before invoking restores.

- Lessons Learned:
  Restoring snapshots can be destructive.

- How to Avoid:

  • Never restore to in-use PVCs without backup.
  • Build snapshot workflows that validate PVC state.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #338: Incomplete Volume Detach Breaks Node Scheduling

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.22, iSCSI

- Summary: Scheduler skipped a healthy node due to a ghost VolumeAttachment that was never cleaned up.

- What Happened:Node marked as ready, but volume controller skipped scheduling new pods due to “in-use” flag on volumes from a deleted pod.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Described unscheduled pod — failed to bind due to volume already attached.
  • VolumeAttachment still referenced old pod.
  • CSI logs showed no detach command received.
  Root Cause: CSI controller restart dropped detach request queue.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Recreated CSI controller pod.
  • Requeued detach operation via manual deletion.

- Lessons Learned:
  CSI recovery from mid-state crash is critical.

- How to Avoid:

  • Persist attach/detach queues.
  • Use cloud-level health checks for cleanup.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #339: App Breaks Due to Missing SubPath After Volume Expansion

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, PVC with subPath

- Summary: After PVC expansion, the mount inside pod pointed to root of volume, not the expected subPath.

- What Happened:Application was configured to mount /data/subdir. After resizing, pod restarted, and subPath was ignored, mounting full volume at /data.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pod logs showed missing directory structure.
  • Inspected pod spec: subPath was correct.
  • CSI logs: subPath expansion failed due to permissions.
  Root Cause: CSI driver did not remap subPath after resize correctly.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Changed pod to recreate the subPath explicitly.
  • Waited for bugfix release from CSI provider.

- Lessons Learned:
  PVC expansion may break subPath unless handled explicitly.

- How to Avoid:

  • Avoid complex subPath usage unless tested under all lifecycle events.
  • Watch CSI release notes carefully.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #340: Backup Restore Process Created Orphaned PVCs

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23, Velero

- Summary: A namespace restore from backup recreated PVCs that had no matching PVs, blocking further deployment.

- What Happened:Velero restored PVCs without matching spec.volumeName. Since PVs weren’t backed up, they remained Pending.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • PVC status showed Pending, with no bound PV.
  • Described PVC: no volumeName, no SC.
  • Velero logs: skipped PV restore due to config.
  Root Cause: Restore policy did not include PVs.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Recreated PVCs manually with correct storage class.
  • Re-enabled PV backup in Velero settings.

- Lessons Learned:
  Partial restores break PVC-PV binding logic.

- How to Avoid:

  • Always back up PVs with PVCs in stateful applications.
  • Validate restore completeness before deployment.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #341: Cross-Zone Volume Binding Fails with StatefulSet

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.25, AWS EBS, StatefulSet with anti-affinity

- Summary: Pods in a StatefulSet failed to start due to volume binding constraints when spread across zones.

- What Happened:Each pod had a PVC, but volumes couldn’t be bound because the preferred zones didn't match pod scheduling constraints.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pod events: failed to provision volume with StorageClass "gp2" due to zone mismatch.
  • kubectl describe pvc showed Pending.
  • StorageClass had allowedTopologies defined, conflicting with affinity rules.
  Root Cause: StatefulSet pods with zone anti-affinity clashed with single-zone EBS volume provisioning.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Updated StorageClass to allow all zones.
  • Aligned affinity rules with allowed topologies.

- Lessons Learned:
  StatefulSets and volume topology must be explicitly aligned.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use multi-zone-aware volume plugins like EFS or FSx when spreading pods.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #342: Volume Snapshot Controller Race Condition

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23, CSI Snapshot Controller

- Summary: Rapid creation/deletion of snapshots caused the controller to panic due to race conditions in snapshot finalizers.

- What Happened:Automation created/deleted hundreds of snapshots per minute. The controller panicked due to concurrent finalizer modifications.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Observed controller crash loop in logs.
  • Snapshot objects stuck in Terminating state.
  • Controller logs: resourceVersion conflict.
  Root Cause: Finalizer updates not serialized under high load.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Throttled snapshot requests.
  • Patched controller deployment to limit concurrency.

- Lessons Learned:
  High snapshot churn breaks stability.

- How to Avoid:

  • Monitor snapshot queue metrics.
  • Apply rate limits in CI/CD snapshot tests.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #343: Failed Volume Resize Blocks Rollout

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, CSI VolumeExpansion enabled

- Summary: Deployment rollout got stuck because one of the pods couldn’t start due to a failed volume expansion.

- What Happened:Admin updated PVC to request more storage. Resize failed due to volume driver limitation. New pods remained in Pending.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • PVC events: resize not supported for current volume type.
  • Pod events: volume resize pending.
  Root Cause: Underlying CSI driver didn't support in-use resize.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Deleted affected pods, allowed volume to unmount.
  • Resize succeeded offline.

- Lessons Learned:
  Not all CSI drivers handle online expansion.

- How to Avoid:

  • Check CSI driver support for in-use expansion.
  • Add pre-checks before resizing PVCs.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #344: Application Data Lost After Node Eviction

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23, hostPath volumes

- Summary: Node drained for maintenance led to permanent data loss for apps using hostPath volumes.

- What Happened:Stateful workloads were evicted. When pods rescheduled on new nodes, the volume path was empty.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Observed empty application directories post-scheduling.
  • Confirmed hostPath location was not shared across nodes.
  Root Cause: hostPath volumes are node-specific and not portable.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Migrated to CSI-based dynamic provisioning.
  • Used NFS for shared storage.

- Lessons Learned:
  hostPath is unsafe for stateful production apps.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use portable CSI drivers for persistent data.
  • Restrict hostPath usage with admission controllers.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #345: Read-Only PV Caused Write Failures After Restore

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.22, Velero, AWS EBS

- Summary: After restoring from backup, the volume was attached as read-only, causing application crashes.

- What Happened:Backup included PVCs and PVs, but not associated VolumeAttachment states. Restore marked volume read-only to avoid conflicts.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pod logs: permission denied on writes.
  • PVC events: attached in read-only mode.
  • AWS console showed volume attachment flag.
  Root Cause: Velero restored volumes without resetting VolumeAttachment mode.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Detached and reattached the volume manually as read-write.
  • Updated Velero plugin to handle VolumeAttachment explicitly.

- Lessons Learned:
  Restores need to preserve attachment metadata.

- How to Avoid:

  • Validate post-restore PVC/PV attachment states.
  • Use snapshot/restore plugins that track attachment mode.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #346: NFS Server Restart Crashes Pods

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, in-cluster NFS server

- Summary: NFS server restarted for upgrade. All dependent pods crashed due to stale file handles and unmount errors.

- What Happened:NFS mount became stale after server restart. Pods using volumes got stuck in crash loops.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pod logs: Stale file handle, I/O error.
  • Kernel logs showed NFS timeout.
  Root Cause: NFS state is not stateless across server restarts unless configured.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Enabled NFSv4 stateless mode.
  • Recovered pods by restarting them post-reboot.

- Lessons Learned:
  In-cluster storage servers need HA design.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use managed NFS services or replicated storage.
  • Add pod liveness checks for filesystem readiness.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #347: VolumeBindingBlocked Condition Causes Pod Scheduling Delay

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.25, dynamic provisioning

- Summary: Scheduler skipped over pods with pending PVCs due to VolumeBindingBlocked status, even though volumes were eventually created.

- What Happened:PVC triggered provisioning, but until PV was available, pod scheduling was deferred.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pod condition: PodScheduled: False, reason VolumeBindingBlocked.
  • StorageClass had delayed provisioning.
  • PVC was Pending for ~60s.
  Root Cause: Volume provisioning time exceeded scheduling delay threshold.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Increased controller timeout thresholds.
  • Optimized provisioning backend latency.

- Lessons Learned:
  Storage latency can delay workloads unexpectedly.

- How to Avoid:

  • Monitor PVC creation latency in Prometheus.
  • Use pre-created PVCs for latency-sensitive apps.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #348: Data Corruption from Overprovisioned Thin Volumes

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.22, LVM-CSI thin provisioning

- Summary: Under heavy load, pods reported data corruption. Storage layer had thinly provisioned LVM volumes that overcommitted disk.

- What Happened:Thin pool ran out of physical space during write bursts, leading to partial writes and corrupted files.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pod logs: checksum mismatches.
  • Node logs: thin pool out of space.
  • LVM command showed 100% usage.
  Root Cause: Thin provisioning wasn't monitored and exceeded safe limits.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Increased physical volume backing the pool.
  • Set strict overcommit alerting.

- Lessons Learned:
  Thin provisioning is risky under unpredictable loads.

- How to Avoid:

  • Monitor usage with lvdisplay, dmsetup.
  • Avoid thin pools in production without full monitoring.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #349: VolumeProvisioningFailure on GKE Due to IAM Misconfiguration

- Category: Storage

- Environment: GKE, Workload Identity enabled

- Summary: CSI driver failed to provision new volumes due to missing IAM permissions, even though StorageClass was valid.

- What Happened:GCP Persistent Disk CSI driver couldn't create disks because the service account lacked compute permissions.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Event logs: failed to provision volume with StorageClass: permission denied.
  • IAM policy lacked compute.disks.create.
  Root Cause: CSI driver operated under workload identity with incorrect bindings.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Granted missing IAM permissions to the bound service account.
  • Restarted CSI controller.

- Lessons Learned:
  IAM and CSI need constant alignment in cloud environments.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use pre-flight IAM checks during cluster provisioning.
  • Bind GKE Workload Identity properly.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #350: Node Crash Triggers Volume Remount Loop

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.26, CSI, NVMes

- Summary: After a node crash, volume remount loop occurred due to conflicting device paths.

- What Happened:Volume had a static device path cached in CSI driver. Upon node recovery, OS assigned a new device path. CSI couldn't reconcile.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • CSI logs: device path not found.
  • Pod remained in ContainerCreating.
  • OS showed volume present under different path.
  Root Cause: CSI assumed static device path, OS changed it post-reboot.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Added udev rules for consistent device naming.
  • Restarted CSI daemon to detect new device path.

- Lessons Learned:
  Relying on device paths can break persistence.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use device UUIDs or filesystem labels where supported.
  • Restart CSI pods post-reboot events.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #351: VolumeMount Conflict Between Init and Main Containers

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.25, containerized database restore job

- Summary: Init container and main container used the same volume path but with different modes, causing the main container to crash.

- What Happened:An init container wrote a backup file to a shared volume. The main container expected a clean mount, found conflicting content, and failed on startup.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pod logs showed file already exists error.
  • Examined pod manifest: both containers used the same volumeMount.path.
  Root Cause: Shared volume path caused file conflicts between lifecycle stages.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Used a subPath for the init container to isolate file writes.
  • Moved backup logic to an external init job.

- Lessons Learned:
  Volume sharing across containers must be carefully scoped.

- How to Avoid:

  • Always use subPath if write behavior differs.
  • Isolate volume use per container stage when possible.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #352: PVCs Stuck in “Terminating” Due to Finalizers

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, CSI driver with finalizer

- Summary: After deleting PVCs, they remained in Terminating state indefinitely due to stuck finalizers.

- What Happened:The CSI driver responsible for finalizer cleanup was crash-looping, preventing PVC finalizer execution.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • PVCs had finalizer external-attacher.csi.driver.io.
  • CSI pod logs showed repeated panics due to malformed config.
  Root Cause: Driver bug prevented cleanup logic, blocking PVC deletion.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Patched the driver deployment.
  • Manually removed finalizers using kubectl patch.

- Lessons Learned:
  CSI finalizer bugs can block resource lifecycle.

- How to Avoid:

  • Regularly update CSI drivers.
  • Monitor PVC lifecycle duration metrics.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #353: Misconfigured ReadOnlyMany Mount Blocks Write Operations

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23, NFS volume

- Summary: Volume mounted as ReadOnlyMany blocked necessary write operations, despite NFS server allowing writes.

- What Happened:VolumeMount was incorrectly marked as readOnly: true. Application failed on write attempts.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Application logs: read-only filesystem.
  • Pod manifest showed readOnly: true.
  Root Cause: Misconfiguration in the volumeMounts spec.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Updated the manifest to readOnly: false.

- Lessons Learned:
  Read-only flags silently break expected behavior.

- How to Avoid:

  • Validate volume mount flags in CI.
  • Use initContainer to test mount behavior.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #354: In-Tree Plugin PVs Lost After Driver Migration

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.26, in-tree to CSI migration

- Summary: Existing in-tree volumes became unrecognized after enabling CSI migration.

- What Happened:Migrated GCE volumes to CSI plugin. Old PVs had legacy annotations and didn’t bind correctly.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • PVs showed Unavailable state.
  • Migration feature gates enabled but missing annotations.
  Root Cause: Backward incompatibility in migration logic for pre-existing PVs.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Manually edited PV annotations to match CSI requirements.

- Lessons Learned:
  Migration feature gates must be tested in staging.

- How to Avoid:

  • Run migration with shadow mode first.
  • Migrate PVs gradually using tools like pv-migrate.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #355: Pod Deleted but Volume Still Mounted on Node

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, CSI

- Summary: Pod was force-deleted, but its volume wasn’t unmounted from the node, blocking future pod scheduling.

- What Happened:Force deletion bypassed CSI driver cleanup. Mount lingered and failed future pod volume attach.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • kubectl describe node showed volume still attached.
  • lsblk confirmed mount on node.
  • Logs showed attach errors.
  Root Cause: Orphaned mount due to force deletion.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Manually unmounted the volume on node.
  • Drained and rebooted the node.

- Lessons Learned:
  Forced pod deletions should be last resort.

- How to Avoid:

  • Set up automated orphaned mount detection scripts.
  • Use graceful deletion with finalizer handling.

## Scenario #356: Ceph RBD Volume Crashes Pods Under IOPS Saturation

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23, Ceph CSI

- Summary: Under heavy I/O, Ceph volumes became unresponsive, leading to kernel-level I/O errors in pods.

- What Happened:Application workload created sustained random writes. Ceph cluster’s IOPS limit was reached.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • dmesg logs: blk_update_request: I/O error.
  • Pod logs: database fsync errors.
  • Ceph health: HEALTH_WARN: slow ops.
  Root Cause: Ceph RBD pool under-provisioned for the workload.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Migrated to SSD-backed Ceph pools.
  • Throttled application concurrency.

- Lessons Learned:
  Distributed storage systems fail silently under stress.

- How to Avoid:

  • Benchmark storage before rollout.
  • Alert on high RBD latency.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #357: ReplicaSet Using PVCs Fails Due to VolumeClaimTemplate Misuse

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.25

- Summary: Developer tried using volumeClaimTemplates in a ReplicaSet manifest, which isn’t supported.

- What Happened:Deployment applied, but pods failed to create PVCs.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Controller logs: volumeClaimTemplates is not supported in ReplicaSet.
  • No PVCs appeared in kubectl get pvc.
  Root Cause: volumeClaimTemplates is only supported in StatefulSet.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Refactored ReplicaSet to StatefulSet.

- Lessons Learned:
  Not all workload types support dynamic PVCs.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use workload reference charts during manifest authoring.
  • Validate manifests with policy engines like OPA.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #358: Filesystem Type Mismatch During Volume Attach

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, ext4 vs xfs

- Summary: A pod failed to start because the PV expected ext4 but the node formatted it as xfs.

- What Happened:Pre-provisioned disk had xfs, but StorageClass defaulted to ext4.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Attach logs: mount failed: wrong fs type.
  • blkid on node showed xfs.
  Root Cause: Filesystem mismatch between PV and node assumptions.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Reformatted disk to ext4.
  • Aligned StorageClass with PV fsType.

- Lessons Learned:
  Filesystem types must match across the stack.

- How to Avoid:

  • Explicitly set fsType in StorageClass.
  • Document provisioner formatting logic.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #359: iSCSI Volumes Fail After Node Kernel Upgrade

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.26, CSI iSCSI plugin

- Summary: Post-upgrade, all pods using iSCSI volumes failed to mount due to kernel module incompatibility.

- What Happened:Kernel upgrade removed or broke iscsi_tcp module needed by CSI driver.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • CSI logs: no such device iscsi_tcp.
  • modprobe iscsi_tcp failed.
  • Pod events: mount timeout.
  Root Cause: Node image didn’t include required kernel modules post-upgrade.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Installed open-iscsi and related modules.
  • Rebooted node.

- Lessons Learned:
  OS updates can break CSI compatibility.

- How to Avoid:

  • Pin node kernel versions.
  • Run upgrade simulations in canary clusters.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #360: PVs Not Deleted After PVC Cleanup Due to Retain Policy

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23, AWS EBS

- Summary: After PVCs were deleted, underlying PVs and disks remained, leading to cloud resource sprawl.

- What Happened:Retain policy on the PV preserved the disk after PVC was deleted.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • kubectl get pv showed status Released.
  • Disk still visible in AWS console.
  Root Cause: PV reclaimPolicy was Retain, not Delete.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Manually deleted PVs and EBS volumes.

- Lessons Learned:
  Retain policy needs operational follow-up.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use Delete policy unless manual cleanup is required.
  • Audit dangling PVs regularly.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #361: Concurrent Pod Scheduling on the Same PVC Causes Mount Conflict

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, AWS EBS, ReadWriteOnce PVC

- Summary: Two pods attempted to use the same PVC simultaneously, causing one pod to be stuck in ContainerCreating.

- What Happened:A deployment scale-up triggered duplicate pods trying to mount the same EBS volume on different nodes.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • One pod was running, the other stuck in ContainerCreating.
  • Events showed Volume is already attached to another node.
  Root Cause: EBS supports ReadWriteOnce, not multi-node attach.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Added anti-affinity to restrict pod scheduling to a single node.
  • Used EFS (ReadWriteMany) for workloads needing shared storage.

- Lessons Learned:
  Not all storage supports multi-node access.

- How to Avoid:

  • Understand volume access modes.
  • Use StatefulSets or anti-affinity for PVC sharing.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #362: StatefulSet Pod Replacement Fails Due to PVC Retention

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.23, StatefulSet with volumeClaimTemplates

- Summary: Deleted a StatefulSet pod manually, but new pod failed due to existing PVC conflict.

- What Happened:PVC persisted after pod deletion due to StatefulSet retention policy.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • kubectl get pvc showed PVC still bound.
  • New pod stuck in Pending.
  Root Cause: StatefulSet retains PVCs unless explicitly deleted.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Deleted old PVC manually to let StatefulSet recreate it.

- Lessons Learned:
  Stateful PVCs are tightly coupled to pod identity.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete only when data can be lost.
  • Automate cleanup for failed StatefulSet replacements.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #363: HostPath Volume Access Leaks Host Data into Container

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.22, single-node dev cluster

- Summary: HostPath volume mounted the wrong directory, exposing sensitive host data to the container.

- What Happened:Misconfigured path / instead of /data allowed container full read access to host.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Container listed host files under /mnt/host.
  • Pod manifest showed path: /.
  Root Cause: Typo in the volume path.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Corrected volume path in manifest.
  • Revoked pod access.

- Lessons Learned:
  HostPath has minimal safety nets.

- How to Avoid:

  • Avoid using HostPath unless absolutely necessary.
  • Validate mount paths through automated policies.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #364: CSI Driver Crashes When Node Resource Is Deleted Prematurely

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.25, custom CSI driver

- Summary: Deleting a node object before the CSI driver detached volumes caused crash loops.

- What Happened:Admin manually deleted a node before volume detach completed.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • CSI logs showed panic due to missing node metadata.
  • Pods remained in Terminating.
  Root Cause: Driver attempted to clean up mounts from a non-existent node resource.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Waited for CSI driver to timeout and self-recover.
  • Rebooted node to forcibly detach volumes.

- Lessons Learned:
  Node deletion should follow strict lifecycle policies.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use node cordon + drain before deletion.
  • Monitor CSI cleanup completion before proceeding.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #365: Retained PV Blocks New Claim Binding with Identical Name

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.21, NFS

- Summary: A PV stuck in Released state with Retain policy blocked new PVCs from binding with the same name.

- What Happened:Deleted old PVC and recreated a new one with the same name, but it stayed Pending.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • PV was in Released, PVC was Pending.
  • Events: PVC is not bound.
  Root Cause: Retained PV still owned the identity, blocking rebinding.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Manually deleted the old PV to allow dynamic provisioning.

- Lessons Learned:
  Retain policies require admin cleanup.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use Delete policy for short-lived PVCs.
  • Automate orphan PV audits.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #366: CSI Plugin Panic on Missing Mount Option

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.26, custom CSI plugin

- Summary: Missing mountOptions in StorageClass led to runtime nil pointer exception in CSI driver.

- What Happened:StorageClass defined mountOptions: null, causing driver to crash during attach.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • CSI logs showed panic: nil pointer dereference.
  • StorageClass YAML had an empty mountOptions: field.
  Root Cause: Plugin didn't check for nil before reading options.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Removed mountOptions: from manifest.
  • Patched CSI driver to add nil checks.

- Lessons Learned:
  CSI drivers must gracefully handle incomplete specs.

- How to Avoid:

  • Validate StorageClass manifests.
  • Write defensive CSI plugin code.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #367: Pod Fails to Mount Volume Due to SELinux Context Mismatch

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, RHEL with SELinux enforcing

- Summary: Pod failed to mount volume due to denied SELinux permissions.

- What Happened:Volume was created with an incorrect SELinux context, preventing pod access.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • Pod logs: permission denied.
  • dmesg showed SELinux AVC denial.
  Root Cause: Volume not labeled with container_file_t.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Relabeled volume with chcon -Rt container_file_t /data.

- Lessons Learned:
  SELinux can silently block mounts.

- How to Avoid:

  • Use CSI drivers that support SELinux integration.
  • Validate volume contexts post-provisioning.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #368: VolumeExpansion on Bound PVC Fails Due to Pod Running

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.25, GCP PD

- Summary: PVC resize operation failed because the pod using it was still running.

- What Happened:Tried to resize a PVC while its pod was active.

- Diagnosis Steps:

  • PVC showed Resizing then back to Bound.
  • Events: PVC resize failed while volume in use.
  Root Cause: Filesystem resize required pod to restart.

- Fix/Workaround:

  • Deleted pod to trigger offline volume resize.
  • PVC then showed FileSystemResizePending → Bound.

- Lessons Learned:
  Some resizes need pod restart.

- How to Avoid:

  • Plan PVC expansion during maintenance.
  • Use fsResizePolicy: "OnRestart" if supported.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scenario #369: CSI Driver Memory Leak on Volume Detach Loop

- Category: Storage

- Environment: Kubernetes v1.24, external CSI

- Summary: CSI plugin leaked memory due to improper garbage collection on detach failure loop.

- What Happened:Detach failed repeatedly due to stale metadata, causing plugin to grow in memory use.

- Diagnosis Steps:
